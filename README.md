Snakeception
============

#### 3D self-playing snake game ####
The snake autonomously seeks out food until you take control. If you get
poisoned, eat away the infected piece!

Features currently in development are leaderboards, multiplayer and levels. An
Inception-style transition between levels will give meaning to the game's name.

#### Usage ####
    git clone https://github.com/mhluska/Snakeception.git snakeception && cd snakeception
    bin/build

Open demo-build.html in a browser (Google Chrome is well supported).
