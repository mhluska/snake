Snakeception
============

#### 3D self-playing snake game ####
The goal is to have a snake game in which the game world can seamlessly 
transform from a 2D plane to a cube. The snake should autonomously seek out 
food until the player takes control. Other crazy ideas include music-adaption 
and Inception-style transitions between levels.
